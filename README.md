# Coderverse - Futuristic Single Landing Page (Next.js Project)

https://github.com/shubhjhawar/coderverse/assets/67875612/6d32abac-5fee-4a82-bcde-817d336b60ce


Welcome to Coderverse! This is a Next.js single landing page project that showcases a slick and futuristic design inspired by the metaverse. The page utilizes motion effects from the `framer-motion` library to create an engaging and dynamic user experience. The elements in the page move gracefully as the user scrolls, adding a touch of interactivity and elegance.

# Live Demo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Usage

To run Coderverse locally, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a development server, and you can access the Coderverse landing page in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Features

- Dynamic motion effects using `framer-motion` to bring life to the elements as the user scrolls.
- Responsive design, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
- Futuristic and visually appealing UI inspired by the metaverse theme.
- Single-page layout for easy navigation and exploration of the content.

## Technologies

Coderverse is built using the following key technologies:

- Next.js: A React framework for server-side rendering and building static websites.
- React: For building the user interface and handling dynamic behavior.
- Framer Motion: For creating smooth motion effects and animations.
- HTML5 and CSS3: For structuring and styling the page.
